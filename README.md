Utilizing an Azure-hosted Large Language Model (LLM) Meta 3.1-405B, the objective is to generate synthetic labels for a dataset comprising patient discharge summaries and follow-up notes.

Synthetic data generation offers an innovative solution to the challenge of insufficient labeled data in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare. 

By producing high-quality synthetic labels for patient records, this method facilitates the creation of machine learning models for critical tasks like predicting patient readmission risks. 

This approach not only ensures compliance with data privacy regulations but also addresses data limitations, enabling scalable and cost-efficient model development.

Key Highlights:
Purpose: Used to train, test, or validate models in scenarios where real data is unavailable, incomplete, or sensitive (e.g., for privacy-related concerns).
Benefits: Scalable, cost-efficient, and inherently privacy-compliant.
Applications: Extensively applied in AI/ML model training, healthcare, robotics, and autonomous systems development.
